    "> Most isotopes of an element are radioactive, i.e., their nuclei are unstable. To better understand what makes a nucleus stable, it is instructive to plot the BE per nucleon, BE/A, of all the isotopes of an element. For example, if one calculates the BE/A for all the isotopes of calcium (Z = 20), as is done in Example 4.2 for one isotope, and plots BE/A versus the neutron number N, a plot like that shown in Fig. 4.2 is obtained. The BE/A rapidly rises as N increase from A = 14 and reaches a broad maximum before rapidly decreasing as N increases above 30. It is in the broad maximum where the BE/A is highest that one finds the stable isotopes. The reason for the zig-zag shape in the maximum region is due to the fact that an isotope with an even number of neutrons tends to have a higher BE/A compared\n",

The mass of the electron should be managed carefully in these cases. In an $n, p$ reaction, a proton is ejected from the nucleus by the incident neutron. During this process, an orbital electron is usually also lost from the resulting product atom.  Thus, we must include an extra electron in the equation. \n",
